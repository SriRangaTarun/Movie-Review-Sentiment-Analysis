I build a classic text classification model with stacked Bidirectional GRUs (with Attention) and a Capsule Layer to classify movie reviews into 5 categories, representing different levels of positivity or negativity (in the reviewer's opinion). You can find the data [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/movie-review-sentiment-analysis-kernels-only/data). I have used GloVe 100-dimensional word embeddings.
